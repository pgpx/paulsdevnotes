## Roles

### [Role Scope Mappings](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_role_scope_mappings)

> Role Scope Mappings limit the roles declared inside an access token. When a client requests a user authentication, the access token they receive contains only the role mappings that are explicitly specified for the clientâ€™s scope. The result is that you limit the permissions of each individual access token instead of giving the client access to all the users permissions.

## Resource servers

* Any client application can be configured to support fine-grained permissions. In doing so, you are conceptually turning the client application into a resource server ([ref](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_resource_server_overview)).
