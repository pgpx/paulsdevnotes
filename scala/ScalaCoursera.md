## Week 1

Imperative programming: modifying mutable variables, assignmets, control structures, Von Neumann architecture.

Want higher-level abstractions and be able to reason about them:

Theory - 1 or more data types, operations on them, laws that describe the relationships between values and operations.  Does not describe mutations (change something while keeping its identity the same)

So: want functions (theories), no place for mutation, powerful ways to abstract and compose functions (what we gain by losing mutation)

* Restricted view of Functional Programming: no mutable, loops, imperative control structures.
* More general: focusing on the functions (particularly functions can be values that are produced, consumed, composed)
