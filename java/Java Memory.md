# Java Memory

Java 8u191 and greater can use a heap based on the amount of RAM available to the container - i.e. the k8s memory limit.  That means that you'll still need to set k8s request/limit, but won't also need to set Java options (other than maybe `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0` which defaults to `25.0`).
