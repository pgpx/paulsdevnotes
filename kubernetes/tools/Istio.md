Istio is built using BoringSSL, which means it does not support TLS 1.0 (and can't be manipulated to use it)

## Configuring the sidecar

Stop Istio capturing inbound traffic (e.g. so that you can access directly via a LoadBalancer service), add the following annotation to the pod/deployment ([ref](https://istio.io/latest/about/faq/traffic-management/#controlling-inbound-ports))

```yaml
traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: ""

# And.or outbound:
traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts: "..."
```

## Issues

### Have to set `safe-to-evict` to allow autoscaler to scale down a node 

* [autoscaler issue #3947](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/3947)
  * also see [istio issue #19395](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/19395))

Right now if you have a sidecar like istio's (istio/istio#19395) with an EmptyDir and the main service without it; the pod is excluded. A work around is to set the annotation

```yaml
cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "true"
```

but that applies at the whole pod level and one would need to duplicate the logic checking for volumes to decide true/false.

### Sidecar container doesn't stop after (cron)job finishes

It is actually a general k8s issue about sidecars not stopping after jobs finish ([k8s issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/25908)).

Current solution is to hack something like the following ([Istio issue](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/6324#issuecomment-760156652) or to just disable Istio for (cron)jobs (also see [Istio issue 11045](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/11045):

```yaml
- command:
  - /bin/sh
  - -c
  - |
    until curl -fsI http://localhost:15021/healthz/ready; do echo \"Waiting for Sidecar...\"; sleep 3; done;
    echo \"Sidecar available. Running the command...\";
    <YOUR_COMMAND>;
    x=$(echo $?); curl -fsI -X POST http://localhost:15020/quitquitquit && exit $x
```

### [Pod or containers start with network issues if istio-proxy is not ready](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/common-problems/injection/#pod-or-containers-start-with-network-issues-if-istio-proxy-is-not-ready)

> Many applications execute commands or checks during startup, which require network connectivity. This can cause application containers to hang or restart if the istio-proxy sidecar container is not ready.
> 
> To avoid this, set holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts to true. This causes the sidecar injector to inject the sidecar at the start of the podâ€™s container list, and configures it to block the start of all other containers until the proxy is ready.
> 
> This can be added as a global config option:

```yaml
values.global.proxy.holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts: true
```

or as a pod annotation:

```yaml
proxy.istio.io/config: '{ "holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts": true }'
```

In Istio IngressGateway Helm:

```yaml
gateway:

    # Preserve source IP, but will require client retries!
    externalTrafficPolicy: "Local"
```

In VirtualServices:

```yaml
