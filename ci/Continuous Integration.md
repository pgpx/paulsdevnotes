# Continuous Integration

* <https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html>
    * Work on main and frequently push.
    * Code-review later.
    * Fix integration bugs caused by the merge to main (but catch them earlier than feature-based merges).

    * Could Use a 'pending head' to run CI on a branch before merging to main, to avoid potengtially breaking everyone's build.  But is that really needed?  https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PendingHead.html (old and pre-Git)
