## Tools

* [Prometheus](https://github.com/kaistAI/prometheus) - an evaluator LM that is open-source, offers reproducible evaluation, and inexpensive to use. Specifically designed for fine-grained evaluation on a customized score rubric, Prometheus is a good alternative for human evaluation and GPT-4 evaluation.
